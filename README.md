ðŸ”¹ Project 1: Bitcoin Price Prediction Using LSTM
Notebook: LSTM_BTC_Final_Model.ipynb

ðŸ“˜ Description:
This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the future price of Bitcoin based on historical price data.

**Optimal Configuration**:
- Data: 6 months of 1-hour intervals

Preprocessing includes scaling, reshaping, and time-window creation

Model trained to forecast the next price point

Visualizations show the accuracy of predictions vs. actual prices

ðŸ“Œ Purpose:
To model temporal patterns in Bitcoin price trends using deep learning for short-term forecasting.

ðŸ”¹ Project 2: Bitcoin Price Movement Classification
Notebook: BTC_Classification.ipynb

ðŸ“˜ Description:
This project uses traditional machine learning to classify whether the next Bitcoin price move will be up or down, based on engineered features from historical data.

âœ… Highlights:
Binary classification (Up/Down) using models like:

Random Forest

Feature engineering includes:

Price returns

Moving averages

Technical indicators (e.g., RSI)

Evaluation with confusion matrix and accuracy metrics

ðŸ“Œ Purpose:
To classify short-term Bitcoin price direction using statistical features and supervised machine learning.
