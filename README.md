ðŸ“ˆ Crypto Price Prediction
This project explores Bitcoin price prediction using two machine learning approaches:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks

Random Forest (RF) regression

It evaluates how historical BTC-USD price data can be used to forecast future prices with different time intervals and data ranges.

ðŸ§ª Best Results
The best performance was achieved in LSTM_BTC_final.ipynb

Configuration:

6 months of historical Bitcoin data

1-hour intervals

This setup produced the highest accuracy using the LSTM model.
