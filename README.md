# Crypto Predictions with LSTM

This project implements an LSTM-based model for cryptocurrency price prediction, focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) price forecasting.

## Key Features

- Uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for time series forecasting
- Processes historical cryptocurrency price data
- Includes data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implements model training and evaluation

## Best Performing Configuration

**The highest model accuracy was achieved using:**
- 6 months of historical Bitcoin price data
- 1-hour interval timeframe
- LSTM architecture with optimal hyperparameters

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmzeda6210/Crypto_Predictions.git
cd Crypto_Predictions
